## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the project
2. Run yarn install
3. If you trying to run iOS simulator and/or devices, run pod install
4. Run react-native run-ios, or react-native run-android

NOTE.- I uploaded the .env file but the main idea is to have the env file OUT of the repo, for security reasons. Given this is a dummy-project, I uploaded the .env file to speed up the run process
